# 1. **Add two numbers**

#    Write a Python program that takes two integer inputs from the user and calculates their sum. The program should perform the following tasks:

# 1: Prompt the user to enter the first number
first_number_input = input("Enter the first number: ")

# 2: Read the input and convert it to an integer
first_number = int(first_number_input)

# 3: Prompt the user to enter the second number
second_number_input = input("Enter the second number: ")

# 4: Read the input and convert it to an integer
second_number = int(second_number_input)

# 5: Calculate the sum of the two numbers
sum_of_numbers = first_number + second_number
print("The sum of the two numbers is:", sum_of_numbers)
